# LeetCode Solutions in C

## Overview

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions in C repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in the C programming language.

### Description

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing and improving your coding skills. It features a large library of coding problems, covering a wide range of difficulty levels and problem domains. These solutions are my personal attempts at solving some of the problems on LeetCode.

## Contents

The repository is organized by problem number and difficulty level. Each solution includes the problem statement and a brief description of my approach to solving it. The solutions are all implemented in C, and include comments to explain the logic behind the code.

## Usage

To use the solutions in this repository, you will need a C compiler. You can then compile and run the solutions using the following commands:

- Copy code
- Run the following commands
```bash
gcc solution.c -o solution
./solution
```
- Replace `solution.c` with the name of the specific solution you want to run.

## Disclaimer
